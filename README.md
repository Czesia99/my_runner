# my_runner
My second graphic project, a basic runner game in CSFML.

to run game :

./my_runner [file.txt] 
the file must contain a b c or d letters,
they represents different traps in game.

in ressources/maps/ there is an exemple that you can try out.

./my_runner -h for more details.
Sorry qwerty users.


```
sudo apt-get install libcsfml-dev libcsfml-doc
```
```
make
```
```
./my_runner ressources/maps/map.txt
```
